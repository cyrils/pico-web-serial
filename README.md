# Pico Web Serial
A web based serial client for [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/). This library uses [Web Serial API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API) to communicate through USB serial port. It can read serial output and supports basic file browsing and code editing. Works only with micropython firmware.

**WORK IN PROGRESS!**  May reformat files while saving. Use with caution!
